Should check for backups when menu 'Backup ... > Delete Previous Backups' is shown (disable if no previous backups to delete).
    Low priority, maybe abandon this altogether.
 
When operating on tasks while lstVu is scrolled, should remember top index for re-selection (now goes back to top of list).
    This is important.  Any task operation ... moving, editing, etc. ... returns list to top index = 0.
        Operations to be changed are:
            Add task
            Edit task
            Move task
 
Tasks need a 'Date Completed' property.
    Will require new column (eventually)
    Will require somewhere to display value on formTaskDetails
 
BUG >>> Moving task left/right (and up/down too?) is persistent ... changes task list whether Save List is pressed or not :(
    5/24/10 : Note - Is only when moving left/right.  Up/down is ok.
    Can't see exactly why this is happening.  Unlike up/down, L/R changes a property of the Task object (U/D changes the Tasklist object).
 
§Put in a 'close CRS?' prompt.
 
§For Backups, need 2 menu options: a) Delete Previous Backups, b) Backup Now
 
Need a Print Tasks option !!!
    Print Tasklist or Selected Tasks ???
    Print to file?
        Text file?  
                Will lose fonts!
                    Not necessarily.  .Txt files support fonts.
 
§Change Menu Hotkey : Move left/right, no 'CTRL'
§All menus under 'More' need accel keys !
 
Strange Bug!  When adding task (+ Above on top row) all tasks were cleared!
    Switching tasklists restored all tasks ok (so TFM's master List(Of Task) wasn't destroyed).  Watch for repeat!!
 
Not having text selected in task text area is a pain.  Maybe have no text there?  Could eliminate 'blank row' option then ... just click Ok to add a blank.
 
§Another Small Bug: When creating new tasklist prompt is issued to 'delete blank row?' (process creates one blank row then deletes it).
§    Need to check out new task list creation completely.  Had another problem = couldn't delete last task (right click said index out of range) after making new task list but after adding about 15 tasks could delete ok.
§        This bug was related to deletion prompt bug.  Both are fixed.
 
Wrote block edit for font and color.
    Need to do some initial setting up of font & color on formEditMultiple (if all selected items are same then post those values).
§    Also might be nice to have samples of fonts as they're selected.
§        Am using task textbox to display font selection.
    Also need to take a serious look at MenuManager.ConfigureMenus, especially when 'state = 3'.  Now that block operations are defined much in this section needs to be re-visited.
        Small Bug: Changing font/color in blocks is persistent.  Answering 'No' to 'save changes?' does not discard changes.
 
Wrote MenuManager and moved ~200 lines of code.  All menu functions now handled in MenuManager class
 
§Small bug: menus up & down on popup aren't enabled on right click when multiple rows are selected.
§    Can enable these because block up/down is now supported
    Was something wrong with notifications/alerts when 'Notify' is checked ???
        Haven't checked notification much.  Tried several and got some good results and 1 bad.
        Had 1 failed notification today.  Set due date but didn't go off :(
 
§Set tray icon text to CRS !!!
 
Settings:
    Default font
 
§Block editing ...
§    Can change Font, Color, and 'Complete' in blocks. - 5/9/10 : Only 'Complete' is in blocks.  Still need to change Font & Color in blocks !!
§    Block move up/down (already have left/right) - Completed 5/9/10
 
§5/5/10 : 
§    Finally solved problem by deleting form1 from active solution and using Form1 (+ files) from the youngest backup.
§    Discarded font dialog, put font details/choices on formTaskDetails in custom controls.
 
§5/3/10 : VERY BAD BUG (VBG).  
§    When closing font dialog on task details, whether Ok or Cancel, dialog closed, form closed, and Form1.lstVu selection highlight became, and stayed, disabled.
§    No code reason was found for the behavior, and lstVu selection did NOT return to normal on re-start.  The behavior was identical in the build version.
§    Backups worked as expected but were missing a new task property, .Font.
